# Lung-Cancer-Risk-Factor-Analysis-and-Visualization
Data-driven investigation of lung cancer risk profiles through exploratory analysis and visualization, highlighting trends and potential predictive features.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This project applies a data science approach to explore lung cancer datasets, focusing on risk factor analysis, visualization, and extraction of meaningful patterns. The goal is to identify potential predictors and lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling using machine learning.

ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS
The analysis reveals several key findings:

- Age Distribution: Peak incidence occurs in patients in their late 20s to late 40s, with a decline in older ages.  
- Gender Distribution: Lung cancer incidence is higher in males than in females.  
- Environmental Factors: Exposure to air pollution, occupational hazards, and passive smoking is strongly linked with higher cancer risk.  
- Lifestyle Factors: Smoking, alcohol use, and obesity contribute significantly to increased risk.  
- Health and Genetic Factors: Genetic risk, chronic lung disease, coughing of blood, dry cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and dust allergy are more prevalent in high-risk patients.  
- Among these, coughing of blood, chest pain, and shortness of breath emerge as particularly strong indicators of high risk.  

VISUALIZATION
The findings are supported by multiple data visualizations:

- Histplot: Age distribution of patients.  
- Countplot: Gender distribution.  
- Bar Plot: Relationship between risk levels and environmental exposures.  
- Box Plot: Links between risk levels and lifestyle factors.  
- Violin Plot: Association of genetic/health risk factors with cancer risk.  
- Heatmap: Correlation among clinical, lifestyle, and environmental features.
